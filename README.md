# DSC170 Final Project
We want to explore the intersectionality between traffic in suburbs, urban areas, and rural areas, and see what type of variables like population density, restaurants, and street sizes could be correlated to how much traffic often goes through specific areas of San Diego. We want to find what ways we can improve areas to get rid of excess traffic or even drive more traffic to areas that want traffic. Our question is a double-sided blade, as it’s motivation lies in the fact that it can help areas that are often cited as not having enough space and too many cars (some examples could include downtown San Diego or Convoy Street) while also allowing chances to test out and revitalize cities and areas of San Diego that are unexplored and want more visitors and tourists. 

The business case for our analysis revolves around allowing people more opportunities to understand the specialties of San Diego without always being bogged down by the same areas that everyone explores. For instance, some of the major areas in San Diego that people visit usually revolve around places like La Jolla Shores and the beaches, or universities like UCSD and SDSU, or even going downtown to watch a Padres game or go to a concert. People rarely realize how large and plentiful San Diego County is; in fact, it’s the 5th most populous county in the United States, so there are a lot of opportunities that people miss when coming here. For our problem, the expected audience would be cities and towns that are in need of more tourists and want to rejuvenate growth of the place’s economy.
