    "Traffic Pattern Analysis\n",
    "* How does traffic in urban, suburban, and rural areas differ? Specifically, what type of accidents happen most often in each respective category?\n",
    "* What are the most accident-prone intersections, highways, and roads in San Diego? Identify high risk areas based on accident frequency and severity\n",

    "* Do different types of accidents correlate with socioeconimic factors?\n",
    "\n",
    "When traffic accidents are portrayed on the news, they are cited as being avoidable and oftentimes the cause of reckless driving, whether that be through sleepy drivers or those under the influence. However, we propose that oftentimes, traffic is not solely caused by reckless driving and individual driver behvaior. Other factors - such as socioeconomic conditions, infrastructure design, and traffic congrestion - play a significant role and are more measurable than human error. \n",
    "\n",
    "By identifying areas with high traffic volume and frequent accidents (relative to their area), we aim to create an interactive map highlighting accident-prone locations and potential contributing factors. This will provide a data-driven approach to understanding traffic safety in San Diego county and offer potential areas of improve to reduce accidents."

    "GIS in Traffic Accident Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "* GIS has been extensively used to study the spatial distribution of traffic accidents, identifying hotspots and danger points in road traffic. For instance, the [FeGIS](https://bmdv.bund.de/SharedDocs/DE/Artikel/DG/mfund-projekte/frueherkennung-von-gefahrenstellen-im-strassenverkehr-fegis.html) (Early Detection of Dangerous Areas in road traffic) project in Germany helped identify these \"danger points\", preventing accidents through timely warnings of danger zones for pedestrians and road users. It offered an outline for proactive identification of danger for EU Road Safety Policy\n",

    "Statistical Methosd in Traffic Safety Research \n",
    "\n",
    "* Statistical and econometrical methods for analyzing crash data and understanding the factors that influence accident occurrences and severities are essential to our project. Researchers like [Fred Mannering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Mannering) have contributed significantly to this field, developing models that account for accident frequency and severity based on road conditions, type, and more. \n",

    "Tools for Spaital Analysis in Traffic Studies\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tools like [CrimeStat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrimeStat) offer spatial statistical functionalities that can be applied to traffic accident analysis. CrimeStat's spatial analytical methods have been adapted for various applications, like finding accident hotspots and modeling travel demand related to traffic accidents."
