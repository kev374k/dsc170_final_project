However, we propose that oftentimes, traffic is not solely caused by reckless driving and individual driver behvaior. Other factors - such as socioeconomic conditions, infrastructure design, and traffic congrestion - play a significant role and are more measurable than human error. \n",

    "Some relevant data quality issues is data age. We want to use more modern data, but also have data that is complete and accurate. We already did this with the collision data, as 2023 and 2024 data were incomplete, which means we had to settle for 2022. However, 2022 is a decent predictor of 2024 and 2025, as the bounceback from COVID had already begun. Fortunately, a topic like traffic accidents is a pretty popular and normal set that is used in data analysis, so there shouldn’t be any problems with it’s metadata. I would expect a lot of the data provided in SANDAG to be mostly reputable, but I do expect some problems with street names or areas that might not have been mapped out that well in the data. We will also encounter the issue of incomplete reporting, where the SANDAG data may not have full information reported for certain fields meaning we will have to impute some data or otherwise acount for the missing data."

    "* Data Analysis - We could look at concentrated places on our map where accidents occur more, and geoenrich a specific part (i.e. Downtown San Diego) to understand why something is happening. For instance, if we saw a lot of traffic in an area along with a lot of pedestrian violence, there might be a higher chance that an accident occurs. Similarly, we could also check restaurants that serve alcohol, and analyze whether or not areas near the restaurants could serve as an indication of an accident happening.\n",
    "* Machine Learning/Modeling - We want to model whether or not accidents are more likely to occur based on a number of variables that we had geoenriched. This could be the aforementioned # of restaurants that serve alcohol, or any sort of number of features that we geoenriched previously, and make sure we have a set of test areas that could be predicted. We could also predict the type of accident that happened spatially, with the same features. For our business case, we could identify certain zip codes or areas that contain a lot of traffic, and see reasons why they might be so traffic heavy compared to other zip codes. \n"
